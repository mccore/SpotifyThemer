#TODO:
#1) up arrow in charts should reain unchanged
#2) compile .png files into .ico
#3) add more options for changing colors (in progress)
#4) add comments to code (done)
#5) allow people to just enter color options on the command line (done)
	#-this can be done by displaying options and letting people choose or by outputting choices in help flag (I like his option best)
